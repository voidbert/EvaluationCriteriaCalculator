# Evaluation Criteria Calculator

A website used to calculate someone's final grade at a subject. This tool calculates a weighted mean
based on evaluation criteria, lists of weights of every evaluation element (like a test or
assignment). You can create your own subjects; learn more about that in `subjects/README.md`.

This website was optimized for usage both on landscape and portrait, computer and mobile
environments.

It is written in Portuguese because it was created to make calculations easier for my classmates
(and I'm from Portugal). It was only published on GitHub as an addition to my portfolio and because
of the free web hosting (GitHub Pages).
